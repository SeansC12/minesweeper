## The Overall Idea of the Program
The Python simulation of Minesweeper will have three files:

- Cell.py
  - `Cell.py` will contain the code for the cell class and its properties.
- Game.py
  - `Game.py` imports the cell class from Cell.py and contains the code for running the game and defining the methods for starting the game, and defining     the win-lose situations. It should also contain the code for keeping track of the number of games that are won and lost, as well as calculating the win-   lose ratio.
- Settings.py
  - `Settings.py` will contain the settings for the game, such as the board size and the number of mines.
- Solver.py
  - `Solver.py` should simulate the playing of the game using the system of equations method


The game will not be GUI-based, as there will be no human input. Instead, the solver will solve the game by calling the class methods of `Cell.py` and `Game.py` that represent the consequences of the simulated user input. At the end of the simulation rounds, there should be a file generated by the `Game.py` file which shows the statistics of the gameplay, as mentioned above.
